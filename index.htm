<h1>Arkansas Levee System's Maintenance</h1>
<h2>A</h2>
<p>Annual Exceedance Probability: The probability that in a given year the water level is higher than the height of the levee.</p>
<h2>B</h2>
<p>Buildings at risk: The estimated number of structures in the leveed area.</p>
<h2>D</h2>
<p>Days since record flood: The number of days since the highest flood stage registered.</p>
<p>Days since the last inspection: The number of days since the last inspection of the levee system.</p>
<h2>I</h2>
<p>Inspection rating:</p>
<h2>L</h2>
<p>Levee length: The length, in mile, of the entire flood control system.</p>
<p>Leveed Area SQ mile: Estimated area of a flood plain from which flood water is excluded by the levee system.</p>
<p>LSAC Rating: Likelihood of inundation due to breach and/or system component malfunction.</p>
<h2>P</h2>
<p>Population at risk: The estimated population within the leveed area.</p>
<p>Property Value: An estimated sum of the structure value, structure contents and vehicles in the leveed area. This value does not include land value, economic productivity loss or transportation infrastructure value (i.e. bridges, runways, roads.)</p>
<h2>S</h2>
